Running the testsuite
=====================

The testsuite requires that you have PHPUnit 3.4 or higher installed.

To run all test:
run "phpunit ." from the tests directory.

If you want to run only certain tests:
run "phpunit Validate/"
This will run all tests in the validate folder.

run "phpunit Validate/YoutubeVideoTest.php"
to only run the Youtube Video tests.

It is important to always call phpunit from the root of the tests folder because
otherwise the tests won't find the bootstrap file needed for setting up the
environment.
